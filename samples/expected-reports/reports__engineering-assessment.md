## Per-resource detail

### rg-contoso-billing-prod-eus

- Type: `Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups` · Region: eastus · RG: rg-contoso-billing-prod-eus · Application group: billing
- Disposition: **recreate-only** via **terraform-redeploy** (alternatives: none)
- Paths — infrastructure: recreate; configuration: reconstruct; identity: not-applicable; data: not-applicable
- Support — RG move: unsupported; subscription move: unsupported; region: unsupported; target region/SKU availability: unknown/unknown
- Expected downtime: none; RTO/RPO compatibility: unknown/unknown; sequence: 25
- Confidence: medium (0.74) — rule confidence 0.95; capped at 0.74: inventory-only evidence cannot yield high confidence
- Rule: azure.resources.resourcegroups v1.0.0 · reason codes: RULE_MATCH, REGION_MOVE_UNSUPPORTED_ALTERNATIVE_SELECTED · human approval: required

**Secondary actions**
- After cutover: re-establish backup and DR protection in the destination (Azure Backup / ASR / native redundancy). This is DR, not migration.

**Evidence**
- [observed-from-csv] name = rg-contoso-billing-prod-eus
- [observed-from-csv] type = Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups
- [observed-from-csv] resourceId = /subscriptions/<assessment-id>/resourceGroups/rg-contoso-billing-prod-eus

- [observed-from-csv] location = eastus
- [observed-from-csv] subscriptionName = Contoso-Prod
- [observed-from-csv] tags = {"application":"billing","environment":"prod","owner":"platform-team"}
- [requires-authenticated-validation] Analysis is based on an exported inventory only; configuration-dependent conclusions must be validated against the live environment.
- [general-rule] Move resources to a new resource group or subscription (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription, 2026-10-03)
- [general-rule] A resource group is a container; its location only stores metadata. Create the destination group and move/recreate the contents.

**Assumptions**
- Questionnaire field 'migrationMode' was not supplied; default used.
- Demo edition: this is a CSV-based illustration, not an authoritative Azure assessment.

**Missing information**
- SKU/tier (affects regional availability, move eligibility and data-copy method)
- Kind (e.g. functionapp vs app, StorageV2 vs BlobStorage)
- Network topology, private endpoints, encryption/CMK, managed identities, RBAC, locks, policy, data size, backup/replication state — require authenticated inspection

### vnet-billing-prod-eus

- Type: `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks` · Region: eastus · RG: rg-contoso-billing-prod-eus · Application group: billing
- Disposition: **native-move** via **azure-resource-mover** (alternatives: terraform-redeploy)
- Paths — infrastructure: recreate; configuration: reconstruct; identity: reconstruct; data: replicate
- Support — RG move: supported; subscription move: supported; region: supported; target region/SKU availability: unknown/unknown
- Expected downtime: minutes; RTO/RPO compatibility: unknown/unknown; sequence: 17
- Confidence: medium (0.74) — rule confidence 0.85; capped at 0.74: inventory-only evidence cannot yield high confidence
- Rule: azure.network.virtualnetworks v1.0.0 · reason codes: RULE_MATCH, REGION_MOVE_SUPPORTED · human approval: required

**Dependencies**
- child → snet-app [discovered]

**Prerequisites**
- All VNet peerings must be removed before a move and re-established afterwards
- Subnets with delegations, service endpoints or private endpoints require the dependent services to be handled first

**Validation**
- Address space, subnets, NSG/UDR associations, peering state, DNS servers

**Secondary actions**
- Data path: replicate — plan initial copy, delta/sync, freeze, final sync, reconciliation and rollback separately from the infrastructure move.
- Identity path: managed identities / Entra bindings are recreated; every RBAC assignment and Key Vault access must be rebound.

- Support — RG move: supported; subscription move: supported; region: conditional; target region/SKU availability: unknown/unknown
- Expected downtime: minutes; RTO/RPO compatibility: unknown/unknown; sequence: 16
- Confidence: medium (0.7) — rule confidence 0.8; conditional support (-0.1)
- Rule: azure.network.publicipaddresses v1.0.0 · reason codes: RULE_MATCH, REGION_MOVE_CONDITIONAL · human approval: required

**Blockers**
- Rule requires human review before this disposition is accepted.

**Risks**
- The IP address value cannot be preserved across regions; DNS records, firewall allowlists and partner integrations must be updated
- Basic SKU public IPs are retired and must be replaced with Standard SKU

**Mitigations**
- Lower DNS TTL ahead of cutover; inventory external allowlists

- network → vnet-billing-prod-eus [inferred] — internal frontend in a subnet (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)

**Risks**
- Constraint: Basic SKU load balancers are retired; plan an upgrade to Standard as part of the migration
- Constraint: Resource Mover supports internal and Standard public load balancers; backend pool members must move in the same move collection

**Secondary actions**
- Data path: replicate — plan initial copy, delta/sync, freeze, final sync, reconciliation and rollback separately from the infrastructure move.
- Identity path: managed identities / Entra bindings are recreated; every RBAC assignment and Key Vault access must be rebound.

- network → nsg-app [inferred] — NSG may be associated to the NIC or subnet (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)
- network → pip-lb-billing [inferred] — public IP may be bound to the NIC (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)

**Risks**
- Constraint: Private IP addresses are re-allocated at the destination unless statically configured in the target subnet range

**Secondary actions**
- Data path: replicate — plan initial copy, delta/sync, freeze, final sync, reconciliation and rollback separately from the infrastructure move.
- Identity path: managed identities / Entra bindings are recreated; every RBAC assignment and Key Vault access must be rebound.
- After cutover: re-establish backup and DR protection in the destination (Azure Backup / ASR / native redundancy). This is DR, not migration.

- Disposition: **native-move** via **azure-resource-mover** (alternatives: azure-migrate, backup-and-restore, terraform-redeploy)
- Paths — infrastructure: recreate; configuration: reconstruct; identity: reconstruct; data: replicate
- Support — RG move: supported; subscription move: supported; region: supported; target region/SKU availability: unknown/unknown
- Expected downtime: minutes; RTO/RPO compatibility: unknown/unknown; sequence: 27
- Confidence: medium (0.74) — rule confidence 0.85; capped at 0.74: inventory-only evidence cannot yield high confidence
- Rule: azure.compute.virtualmachines v1.0.0 · reason codes: RULE_MATCH, REGION_MOVE_SUPPORTED · human approval: required

**Dependencies**
- hard → nic-vm-billing-01 [inferred] — VMs attach NICs; the NIC must exist in the destination VNet first (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)
- hard → vm-billing-01_osdisk [inferred] — OS/data disks move with the VM (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)
- soft → avset-billing [inferred] — availability set membership is set at VM creation (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)

**Prerequisites**
- Dependent NICs, disks, VNet, NSG and public IPs move together or already exist at the destination
- Stop Azure Backup/ASR protection before the move; re-enable afterwards

**Risks**
- VM must be deallocated for a region move; public IP address changes
- Extensions and boot diagnostics storage must be re-pointed
- Constraint: VMs with Azure Site Recovery replication, Azure Backup protection, or marketplace plans need the protection removed or the plan accepted before move
- Constraint: Resource Mover requires managed disks; unmanaged disks are not supported

**Mitigations**
- Schedule within the downtime window; pre-stage DNS TTL reductions

**Validation**
- VM boots and agent reports Ready
- Disk count/size match
- NSG/route effective rules match
- Application smoke test

**Rollback**
- Resource Mover: discard the move and restore source; ARM move: move back to the source scope

**Secondary actions**
- Data path: replicate — plan initial copy, delta/sync, freeze, final sync, reconciliation and rollback separately from the infrastructure move.
- Identity path: managed identities / Entra bindings are recreated; every RBAC assignment and Key Vault access must be rebound.
- After cutover: re-establish backup and DR protection in the destination (Azure Backup / ASR / native redundancy). This is DR, not migration.

**Evidence**

**Prerequisites**
- Storage Mover agent or cloud-to-cloud job authorized against source and destination with managed identity (no account keys)

**Blockers**

- Constraint: Databases move with the logical server; a cross-region move creates a geo-secondary then promotes it (near-zero data loss) or uses BACPAC export/import for offline moves
- Constraint: Elastic pool membership must exist at the destination before the database is replicated

**Validation**
- Row counts per table; checksum on critical tables
- Replication lag zero at cutover
- Application connection string switched to the listener/new server

**Rollback**

**Validation**
- All app settings present (no unresolved Key Vault references)
- Custom domains bound, TLS valid
- Smoke test and health check endpoint

**Rollback**
- Keep the source app running until DNS cutover is verified; revert DNS

**Secondary actions**

- Rule: azure.insights.metricalerts v1.0.0 · reason codes: RULE_MATCH, REGION_MOVE_SUPPORTED · human approval: required

**Dependencies**
- soft → ag-platform-oncall [inferred] — alert actions reference action groups (inferred from type and shared resource group; confirm with authenticated discovery)

**Secondary actions**
- Identity path: managed identities / Entra bindings are recreated; every RBAC assignment and Key Vault access must be rebound.
- After cutover: re-establish backup and DR protection in the destination (Azure Backup / ASR / native redundancy). This is DR, not migration.

**Evidence**

- Support — RG move: unknown; subscription move: unknown; region: unknown; target region/SKU availability: unknown/unknown
- Expected downtime: unknown; RTO/RPO compatibility: unknown/unknown; sequence: 24
- Confidence: low (0.2) — No versioned rule exists for this resource type; the engine does not guess support.
- Rule: none v— · reason codes: NO_RULE_FOR_TYPE · human approval: required

**Blockers**
- No rule coverage: disposition cannot be determined automatically.

**Secondary actions**
- Escalate for manual review against the Microsoft Learn move-support matrix.

**Assumptions**
- Questionnaire field 'migrationMode' was not supplied; default used.
- Demo edition: this is a CSV-based illustration, not an authoritative Azure assessment.

**Missing information**
- Support rule for Microsoft.Quantum/Workspaces — add one under rules/azure or escalate for manual review
