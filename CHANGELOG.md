> **Repository split (2026-10-04, ADR-0027).** This file predates the split of the monorepo into `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` and `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App`. This repository (`saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon`) holds the shared core, rules, CLI, lab API, lab web harness and the UI package. Entries below describe the monorepo as it was; paths that moved to the sibling repository are noted there.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-04 (Node 26 runtime floor, ADR-0029)

- Coordinated runtime bump to **Node 26** across every surface: `engines.node >=26` (repository and both published packages), `@types/node ^26.6.4`, `setup-node 26` in every workflow, `node:26-bookworm-slim` in the appliance image, the Node 26 devcontainer, and `--target=node26` for the single-executable CLI. Supersedes the lone Dockerfile bump Dependabot proposed. Verified locally on Node 26.5: 88 tests, clean-consumer gate, appliance image (starts, Trivy clean), CLI executable smoke.
- Dependabot: merged `actions/checkout` 7.0.1, `actions/upload-artifact` 7.0.1, `docker/metadata-action` 6.2.0, `docker/setup-buildx-action` 4.4.1 (SHA pins kept).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-04 (ADR-0028: this repository is the upstream product)

- **Flip.** The engine (`packages/*`), rule corpus, `amo` CLI and explorer UI components moved here from `_Addon`; this repository now builds and runs alone and publishes `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` (17 subpath exports + `rules/`) and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui` from `dist-packages/` (`scripts/assemble-packages.mjs`, run by `npm run build`). The Azure clients (`azure-auth`, `azure-arm`, `azure-execution`) stay here and are never published.
- `evidence-engine`: `defaultRulesDir()` falls back to the package-relative `rules/` so consumers of the npm package need no configuration.
- `tests/packaging` (shape of the assembled packages), `tests/security/appliance-boundary` (Azure clients excluded from the published core; CLI stays lab-side), `scripts/verify-packed-consumer.mjs` (pack → install from tarballs into an empty project → run an assessment → type-check; CI job `packed-consumer`).
- `publish-npm.yml`: npm trusted publishing with provenance, gated on the repository variable `NPM_TRUSTED_PUBLISHING=ready` (owner bootstrap: `docs/release/npm-publishing.md`). `publish-images.yml` publishes the appliance image (scan before push). `release-cli.yml` and `rules-refresh.yml` moved here.
- `Dockerfile.appliance` is a single-repository build again (npm-free runtime, Debian upgrades, `tsc -b --force`).
- The web-front edition (`_Addon`) now consumes this repository's releases through its `core-update` workflow (downstream flow).

## Unreleased — 2026-10-04 (Phase 1 of WORKING-PLAN.md)

- ADR-0027: publish as two public repositories — `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` (appliance) and `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` (lab, UI package, shared core). ADR-0017 cross-linked; `WORKING-PLAN.md` hosting table and Phases 1–2 updated; package names `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui`.
- `publish-images.yml`: lab matrix entry referenced itself; now `infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.lab`.
- `packages/contracts`: the questionnaire credential filter rejected `applicationGroupTagKey`; `key` is now blocked except as the `…TagKey` suffix. Tests cover both directions.
- Obsolete `hcw-architect` owner/image/clone references replaced with `saulpatinojr` (CODEOWNERS, compose, Coder, Terraform defaults, deployment docs); website integration guide installs the published package at an exact version or an `_Addon` release tag.
- `.gitignore`: `*.tfplan`.
- Repository trees built (ADR-0027): `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` (core, rules, CLI, lab, UI package; 316 files) and `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` (appliance; 133 files) generated as siblings of the monorepo, each with its own workspaces, lockfile, CI, CODEOWNERS, manifest and packaging. `packages/azure-discovery` reduced to the interface in `_Addon`; its Resource Graph, validate-move and scope clients became `packages/azure-arm` in `_App`; `apps/appliance-api` imports updated. `_App` links the core via `file:` to the sibling checkout, pinned in CI at `ADDON_REF=v0.1.0`.
- Boundary tests: `_Addon` `edition-boundary` now forbids any dependency on `@amo/azure-auth`, `@amo/azure-arm`, `@amo/azure-execution` or `@azure/*` and checks the interface package has no Azure endpoint or auth import; `_App` adds `appliance-boundary`.
- Coder template HCL: two single-line blocks used `;`; fixed, `terraform fmt` applied, `terraform validate` passes.
- `scripts/package-repository.ps1`: excluded every file (array element parsed as a bare `# Changelog
- `v0.1.3`: first fully verified release — lab image published after passing the scan gate (`ghcr.io/saulpatinojr/azure-migration-orchestrator-lab@sha256:e5aa04aa524e35811ebcc565348f80c72207f1a80de81679eb3ddd73b3e24c47`), CLI binaries for three platforms with checksums and provenance.
- `v0.1.2`: `release-cli` published `amo-linux-x64`, `amo-darwin-arm64`, `amo-windows-x64.exe` with checksums and provenance; `publish-images` refused to push because the Trivy gate found a fixed HIGH CVE in the Debian base image (`libpcre2-8-0`, CVE-2026-103111). The lab runtime stage now runs `apt-get upgrade` so base-image security fixes are applied at build time; a local Trivy scan of the rebuilt image is clean.
- Release workflows (after `v0.1.1` failed): `publish-images.yml` now builds locally, scans with Trivy, and only then pushes with provenance and SBOM, so a failing scan publishes nothing; the lab runtime image drops the bundled `npm`/`npx`/`corepack` (the `v0.1.1` scan flagged npm's vendored `sigstore`, CVE-2026-48815); `tsc -b --force` inside the image so stale `*.tsbuildinfo` can never suppress emission. The Coder workspace image moved to the manual `publish-workspace-image.yml` while Coder stays disabled. `build-sea.sh` names binaries `amo-<os>-<arch>[.exe]`, writes `SHA256SUMS-<os>-<arch>.txt` and removes intermediates; `release-cli.yml` smoke-tests the one binary (`rules validate` and a sample `assess`), uploads binaries plus checksums, and no longer cancels sibling OS jobs.
- First CI run after publication: `aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.29.0` never existed (tags are v-prefixed from v0.30.0); every action is now pinned to a full commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment. `release-cli.yml` was an invalid workflow file (unquoted `${{ matrix.os }}` inside a flow mapping); rewritten in block style. The Terraform generator emitted an invalid single-line `variable "location"` block when a destination region was set; root module calls now pass through every variable a module references and each module declares them (previously `terraform validate` failed with "Missing required argument" for NIC, image and service-plan ids and `ssh_public_key`); `terraform init`/`validate` of generated bundles pass for region relocation and cross-tenant (root and hcp; provider deprecation warnings only). Golden `terraform__main.tf` regenerated deliberately for the added arguments. The Playwright harness server binds 127.0.0.1 and is awaited by URL (Linux runners resolve `localhost` to ::1).

 regex) and `Compress-Archive` failed on dotfiles; rewritten on `System.IO.Compression` with a built-in leak check. Verified in all three trees.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 7 — operations and e2e)

- Compiled Tailwind 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@source` on `packages/ui`) for `apps/appliance-web`; play CDN removed; MSAL/React manual chunks.
- `apps/ui-harness`: lazy-island host for `@amo/ui` mirroring the site integration.
- Playwright e2e (`tests/e2e/lab.spec.ts`) through the harness against the real lab API; CI job `e2e`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 6 — appliance depth)

- `ScopeInventory`: subscriptions across home tenant and Lighthouse delegations; `GET /api/scopes`; cross-tenant intent derived from subscription directories (ADR-0025).
- PostgreSQL Entra authentication: `pg` password provider exchanging the appliance credential for a database token; password-bearing URLs refused for Azure hosts.
- `apps/appliance-web`: Vite + React + MSAL (PKCE) UI reusing `@amo/ui` — scopes, assessments, validate-move, approvals, Resource Mover actions with gate reasons. Built in CI.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 5 — reach)

- Single-executable `amo` CLI (Node SEA + esbuild) with the rule corpus embedded; `release-cli.yml` for Linux/macOS/Windows with provenance (ADR-0024).

- `docs/product/marketplace-evaluation.md`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 4 — guided lab)

- `lab-api`: `POST /api/assessments/{id}/workspace` creates a Coder workspace via the provider abstraction; one-time 10-minute bundle tokens (`x-bundle-token`) for the workspace download; feature hidden when no provider is configured (ADR-0023).
- `packages/ui`: "Open in Coder (guided lab)" shown only when `/api/health` reports a workspace provider.
- Coder template parameters (`assessment_id`, `bundle_token`, `api_base_url`), workspace image Dockerfile, `coder-template.yml` push workflow; workspace image added to `publish-images.yml`.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 3 — appliance)

- `@amo/azure-auth`: dependency-free Entra token validation (JWKS/RS256) and credentials (Azure CLI, managed identity, workload identity federation); client secrets rejected.
- `@amo/azure-discovery`: Resource Graph REST provider (paged, 403 → permission gap) and ARM `validateMoveResources` evidence.
- `@amo/azure-execution`: Resource Mover client with gated prepare/initiateMove/commit/discard.
- `apps/appliance-api`: token-validated routes, assessments by scope, validate-move, approvals, execution, audit; repository with in-memory and PostgreSQL (`pg`) implementations (Entra-only DB auth).
- `infrastructure/terraform/appliance-azure`: Container Apps, user-assigned identity, PostgreSQL Flexible Server (private, Entra-only), Log Analytics/App Insights, Entra app registration with app roles.

- `terraform/hcp/`: HCP Terraform workspace (VCS-driven, manual apply, workload identity federation) and cloud block example.
- `argument-manifest.json` + schema check (`terraform providers schema -json` or Terraform MCP adapter); CI validates the golden bundle with the real `azurerm` provider.
- Learn move-support parser + diff, `scripts/refresh-rules-from-learn.mjs`, weekly `rules-refresh.yml` opening a report PR (ADR-0021).
- Questionnaire: optional destination subscription / resource group for exact new-ID computation.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 1)

- Apps renamed by deployable: `lab-api`, `lab-web` (harness), `appliance-api`; edition boundary frozen by test (ADR-0017).
- `packages/ui`: React 19 components (Radix Dialog/Tabs, Tailwind classes) for the content site; `LabApiClient`; partner panel.
- Per-operation confidence on every decision (ADR-0018).
- `lab-api`: exact-origin CORS, Cloudflare Turnstile verification, `cf-connecting-ip` handling.
- Edge: Cloudflare Tunnel replaces Caddy; VPS opens no inbound ports (ADR-0019). Terraform for Hostinger VPS and Cloudflare edge.
- GHCR publish workflow with SLSA provenance + SBOM + image scan; `copilot-setup-steps.yml`.
