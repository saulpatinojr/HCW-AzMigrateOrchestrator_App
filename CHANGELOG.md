# Changelog

> **Repository split (2026-10-04, ADR-0027).** This file predates the split of the monorepo into `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` and `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App`. This repository (`saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App`) holds the Azure appliance (appliance-api, appliance-web, worker, azure-auth, azure-arm, azure-execution, appliance Terraform). Entries below describe the monorepo as it was; paths that moved to the sibling repository are noted there.

## Unreleased — 2026-10-04 (Phase 1 of WORKING-PLAN.md)

- ADR-0027: publish as two public repositories — `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` (appliance) and `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` (lab, UI package, shared core). ADR-0017 cross-linked; `WORKING-PLAN.md` hosting table and Phases 1–2 updated; package names `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui`.
- `publish-images.yml`: lab matrix entry referenced itself; now `infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.lab`.
- `packages/contracts`: the questionnaire credential filter rejected `applicationGroupTagKey`; `key` is now blocked except as the `…TagKey` suffix. Tests cover both directions.
- Obsolete `hcw-architect` owner/image/clone references replaced with `saulpatinojr` (CODEOWNERS, compose, Coder, Terraform defaults, deployment docs); website integration guide installs the published package at an exact version or an `_Addon` release tag.
- `.gitignore`: `*.tfplan`.
- Release: `publish-images.yml` builds locally, scans with Trivy, and only then pushes with provenance and SBOM (a failing scan publishes nothing); `Dockerfile.appliance` drops the bundled `npm`/`npx`/`corepack` from the runtime stage and builds with `tsc -b --force`. Verified locally from the two-tree context: core import resolves, rules present, API starts, no `npm`. `ADDON_REF` → `v0.1.2`.
- Repository trees built (ADR-0027): `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` (core, rules, CLI, lab, UI package; 316 files) and `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` (appliance; 133 files) generated as siblings of the monorepo, each with its own workspaces, lockfile, CI, CODEOWNERS, manifest and packaging. `packages/azure-discovery` reduced to the interface in `_Addon`; its Resource Graph, validate-move and scope clients became `packages/azure-arm` in `_App`; `apps/appliance-api` imports updated. `_App` links the core via `file:` to the sibling checkout, pinned in CI at `ADDON_REF=v0.1.0`.
- Boundary tests: `_Addon` `edition-boundary` now forbids any dependency on `@amo/azure-auth`, `@amo/azure-arm`, `@amo/azure-execution` or `@azure/*` and checks the interface package has no Azure endpoint or auth import; `_App` adds `appliance-boundary`.
- Coder template HCL: two single-line blocks used `;`; fixed, `terraform fmt` applied, `terraform validate` passes.
- `scripts/package-repository.ps1`: excluded every file (array element parsed as a bare `# Changelog

 regex) and `Compress-Archive` failed on dotfiles; rewritten on `System.IO.Compression` with a built-in leak check. Verified in all three trees.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 7 — operations and e2e)

- `apps/worker`: polls Azure long-running operations recorded by the API (Resource Mover), persists status, audits completion; `GET /api/operations/{targetKey}`; `operations` table; worker Container App and compose service (ADR-0026).
- Compiled Tailwind 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@source` on `packages/ui`) for `apps/appliance-web`; play CDN removed; MSAL/React manual chunks.
- `apps/ui-harness`: lazy-island host for `@amo/ui` mirroring the site integration.
- Playwright e2e (`tests/e2e/lab.spec.ts`) through the harness against the real lab API; CI job `e2e`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 6 — appliance depth)

- `ScopeInventory`: subscriptions across home tenant and Lighthouse delegations; `GET /api/scopes`; cross-tenant intent derived from subscription directories (ADR-0025).
- PostgreSQL Entra authentication: `pg` password provider exchanging the appliance credential for a database token; password-bearing URLs refused for Azure hosts.
- `apps/appliance-web`: Vite + React + MSAL (PKCE) UI reusing `@amo/ui` — scopes, assessments, validate-move, approvals, Resource Mover actions with gate reasons. Built in CI.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 5 — reach)

- Single-executable `amo` CLI (Node SEA + esbuild) with the rule corpus embedded; `release-cli.yml` for Linux/macOS/Windows with provenance (ADR-0024).
- `amo rules coverage`; `GET /api/rules/coverage`; `docs/rules/coverage.md` generator.
- Opt-in aggregate telemetry (`AMO_TELEMETRY=1`, `GET /api/stats`) — counts only, tested to exclude identifiers.
- First organizational overlay: `rules/organization/hcw-standards.json` (Storage Mover over AzCopy); snapshot 1.0.35.
- `docs/product/marketplace-evaluation.md`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 4 — guided lab)

- `lab-api`: `POST /api/assessments/{id}/workspace` creates a Coder workspace via the provider abstraction; one-time 10-minute bundle tokens (`x-bundle-token`) for the workspace download; feature hidden when no provider is configured (ADR-0023).
- `packages/ui`: "Open in Coder (guided lab)" shown only when `/api/health` reports a workspace provider.
- Coder template parameters (`assessment_id`, `bundle_token`, `api_base_url`), workspace image Dockerfile, `coder-template.yml` push workflow; workspace image added to `publish-images.yml`.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 3 — appliance)

- `@amo/azure-auth`: dependency-free Entra token validation (JWKS/RS256) and credentials (Azure CLI, managed identity, workload identity federation); client secrets rejected.
- `@amo/azure-discovery`: Resource Graph REST provider (paged, 403 → permission gap) and ARM `validateMoveResources` evidence.
- `@amo/azure-execution`: Resource Mover client with gated prepare/initiateMove/commit/discard.
- `apps/appliance-api`: token-validated routes, assessments by scope, validate-move, approvals, execution, audit; repository with in-memory and PostgreSQL (`pg`) implementations (Entra-only DB auth).
- `infrastructure/terraform/appliance-azure`: Container Apps, user-assigned identity, PostgreSQL Flexible Server (private, Entra-only), Log Analytics/App Insights, Entra app registration with app roles.
- `Dockerfile.appliance`; `publish-images.yml` publishes lab and appliance images with provenance + SBOM.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 2 — HashiCorp depth)

- `terraform/state-impact/`: `removed` + `import` blocks and `state-mv.sh` for ID changes caused by ARM moves / Resource Mover (ADR-0020).
- `terraform/hcp/`: HCP Terraform workspace (VCS-driven, manual apply, workload identity federation) and cloud block example.
- `argument-manifest.json` + schema check (`terraform providers schema -json` or Terraform MCP adapter); CI validates the golden bundle with the real `azurerm` provider.
- Learn move-support parser + diff, `scripts/refresh-rules-from-learn.mjs`, weekly `rules-refresh.yml` opening a report PR (ADR-0021).
- Questionnaire: optional destination subscription / resource group for exact new-ID computation.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-03 (Sprint 1)

- Apps renamed by deployable: `lab-api`, `lab-web` (harness), `appliance-api`; edition boundary frozen by test (ADR-0017).
- `packages/ui`: React 19 components (Radix Dialog/Tabs, Tailwind classes) for the content site; `LabApiClient`; partner panel.
- Per-operation confidence on every decision (ADR-0018).
- `lab-api`: exact-origin CORS, Cloudflare Turnstile verification, `cf-connecting-ip` handling.
- Edge: Cloudflare Tunnel replaces Caddy; VPS opens no inbound ports (ADR-0019). Terraform for Hostinger VPS and Cloudflare edge.
- GHCR publish workflow with SLSA provenance + SBOM + image scan; `copilot-setup-steps.yml`.
- Partner one-pagers and site integration guide.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

Initial build of the shared migration intelligence core, demo edition (CLI, API, static UI), enterprise API skeleton,
34 versioned rules, 19 agent definitions with deterministic orchestration and Safety Agent, output bundle generators,
VPS/Docker/Coder infrastructure, GitHub Copilot review pack, 51 automated tests. Limitations in `VALIDATION.md`.
