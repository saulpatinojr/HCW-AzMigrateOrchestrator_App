# ADR-0025: Lighthouse-aware scopes, PostgreSQL Entra authentication, and the appliance web UI

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-10-03

## Decisions
1. **Scopes across tenants.** `ScopeInventory` lists subscriptions through Resource Graph (`resourcecontainers`), marking
   those whose `tenantId` differs from the home tenant as Lighthouse-delegated. `POST /api/assessments` derives
   `sameTenant`/`sameSubscription` from the source and destination subscriptions when both are known, so cross-tenant
   planning is driven by observed directory membership instead of a questionnaire answer.
2. **PostgreSQL without passwords.** `pg` receives `password` as an async function that exchanges the appliance's credential
   for a token in the `https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net/.default` scope on every new connection. Non-local
   `DATABASE_URL`s with embedded passwords are refused; Azure hosts require a `TokenCredential`.
3. **Appliance web.** `apps/appliance-web` is a Vite + React SPA using `@azure/msal-browser` (authorization code + PKCE,
   session-storage cache, no secret) against a separate public-client app registration, calling the API with the
   `access_as_user` scope. It reuses `@amo/ui` for decisions, detail and waves and adds scope selection, validate-move,
   approval recording and the four Resource Mover actions with the gate's reason surfaced on refusal. Tailwind is loaded
   from the play CDN for now; a compiled Tailwind build is a follow-up before production.

## Consequences
Cross-tenant intent stops being self-reported in the appliance; database credentials vanish from configuration; operators
have a UI that cannot bypass the gate because it only calls the same API. Live validation of MSAL, Lighthouse projection and
the PostgreSQL token exchange remains pending (VALIDATION.md).
