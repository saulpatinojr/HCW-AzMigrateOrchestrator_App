# ADR-0030: The web-front edition runs as a site pane

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-10-10 · **Supersedes the "website installs the UI package from npm" consequence of ADR-0028 and the WORKING-PLAN Phase 3 line "do not frame a second explorer UI"**

## Context

ADR-0028 made this repository the upstream product and left the website's integration path as an npm island: the site
would install `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui` at an exact version once the packages were published. That path has not
opened. npm publication is paused by the owner (`docs/release/npm-publishing.md`), and the website's own rules would
refuse the island even when it resumes: its content security policy closes `connect-src` to its own origin, so an
embedded explorer could not reach a lab API on another host; its public-copy rule forbids vendor names on public pages,
which the explorer's partner panel carries; and an island ties the site's deploy to this repository's release cadence.

The website already runs independently deployed tools as sandboxed panes (its Coder labs): a catalogue row, a
`frame-src` entry, a server-side status proxy and a lab host behind Caddy. On 2026-10-09 the owner generalised that
model for every HCW AddOn (website ADR 0035 and the HCW AddOn Integration Standard) and rejected the npm island. The
downstream edition `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` therefore needs a pane app of its own that mounts
`MigrationExplorer`, and the explorer must be mountable inside a frame: same-origin API by default, no partner copy,
stage events for the pane protocol, and host-mediated navigation, because the site's `frame-ancestors 'none'` blocks
in-frame links back to the site.

## Decision

1. The web-front edition is a separately deployed web application at `https://migration.lab.hybridcloudworks.com`,
   framed by the site at `/tools/migration`. The downstream repository owns the pane app (`apps/lab-web`), the pane
   protocol implementation, the lab API's framing headers, rate limiting and concurrency, the container image
   (`docker.io/hybridcloudworks/hcw-addon-migration`, pinned by digest on the website's lab host) and the
   website-integration docs. The website owns the catalogue row, the page, the CSP entry, the status proxy and the
   Ansible `addons` role.
2. This repository makes `MigrationExplorer` pane-ready with optional, additive props: `apiBaseUrl` (default `""`),
   `partners`, `cta`, `onStageChange`, `onNavigate`, `contactPath`; it exports `Stage` and `EnterpriseCta`. Engine,
   rules, limits, the confidence cap and the edition boundary do not change.
3. The contract shared by the AddOn and the website's status proxy lives in `packages/contracts`: `AddOnHealth` (flat
   envelope `ok, id, version, edition, capabilities, asOf, siteOrigins, turnstile`), `ADDON_HEALTH_FIELDS`,
   `isAddOnHealth`, `ADDON_PANE_STATES`, `AddOnPaneState`, `AddOnPaneMessage`. The AddOn serves it; this repository
   defines it; the website reads only its six-field projection.
4. The partner panel (`PoweredBy`) stays in the package for the appliance web and the default explorer and is never
   rendered in the site pane (`partners={false}`).
5. npm publication of the two packages becomes optional for the website path. It remains the intended distribution
   for third-party consumers and the long-term replacement of the `file:` link (ADR-0028, item 4), but nothing on
   hybridcloudworks.com waits on it.

## Consequences

- The site's deploy and this repository's release cadence are decoupled: a new explorer reaches visitors when the AddOn
  adopts the release through `core-update`, tags, and the website moves one image digest.
- `MigrationExplorer` renders with no props; every existing caller (`apps/appliance-web`, the downstream harness)
  keeps working unchanged.
- The pane protocol and the health envelope are versioned by the website's standard; a breaking change to either is a
  new revision there and a major version here.
- WORKING-PLAN Phase 3 is rewritten: route `/tools/migration`, hostname `migration.lab.hybridcloudworks.com`, hosting
  by the website's `addons` role, rate limiting and concurrency delivered downstream, npm publication optional.
- `edition` stays `demo` in the lab API's health; the site's proxy treats the string as opaque.
- Next ADR number: 0031.
