# Requirement ledger

Source: the master implementation prompt (sections §1–§25; the supplied copy ends mid-§25). Each requirement has an ID,
an implementation status for **this build**, and pointers. Status legend: **Done** (implemented and tested), **Partial**
(implemented with documented gaps), **Interface** (contract + safe local adapter, real integration pending), **Planned**
(documented, not built). The traceability matrix (`docs/traceability-matrix.md`) maps IDs to code, tests and docs.
