# GitHub Copilot repository instructions

For pull-request review or re-review, use `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` and apply only the component references relevant to the diff.

Treat GitHub Copilot as one teammate with separate review and remediation hats:

- `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` reviews.
- Copilot cloud agent / `copilot-swe-agent` fixes only when explicitly requested.

A fix that demonstrably closes the original finding closes that finding: acknowledge and resolve the thread, then evaluate the current head. Do not keep a PR open merely to re-derive a closed finding. If the fix does not close it, explain the remaining failure path, correct it when authorized, and request another review. Handle disagreement on-thread with evidence and a counter-proposal; unsupported suspicion is not a finding.

After any AI coding partner (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI Codex, or other declared partner) creates or changes code, route the result through the GitHub review -> fix -> current-head verification cycle before merge.

Never expose secrets. Never treat a stale/older-head check as current evidence. Never treat a resolved review thread as proof that required checks or approvals are satisfied.

## This repository

This is `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App`: the appliance **and** the migration intelligence core (engine, rules, CLI, UI components) it is built on — the upstream product (ADR-0028). It publishes `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui`; the slim web-front edition in `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` consumes them.
