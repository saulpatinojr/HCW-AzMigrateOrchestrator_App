# Infrastructure

| Path | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `docker/Dockerfile.appliance` | Appliance API + worker image on `node:26-bookworm-slim`: multi-stage build, Debian security upgrades, npm removed from the runtime, non-root, health check. Published by `publish-images.yml` after a Trivy scan, with provenance and SBOM | Supported build; deploy by digest |
| `terraform/appliance-azure/` | Full experimental template: Container Apps, user-assigned identity, PostgreSQL Flexible Server (Entra-only), Log Analytics / App Insights, Entra app registration with app roles | **Experimental.** Validates in CI (`iac-validate`); never applied. The first deployment uses the smaller `appliance-project` profile planned in `WORKING-PLAN.md` Phase 4 (one Consumption Container App, session-only storage, Reader-only identity, execution disabled) |

Rules: Terraform has one owner per resource; state, plans, variable files and credentials never enter Git; apply is a
reviewed manual action from the HCP Terraform workspace (Phase 5). The lab infrastructure (Hostinger VPS, Cloudflare edge,
Coder) lives downstream in `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon/infrastructure`.
